    "# Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Install `nbsphinx` with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/):\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install nbsphinx --user\n",
    "\n",
    "In the directory with your notebook files, run this command (assuming you have [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) installed already):\n",
    "\n",
    "    sphinx-quickstart\n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer the questions that appear on the screen. In case of doubt, just press the `<Return>` key to take the default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, there will be a few brand-new files in the current directory.\n",
    "You'll have to make a few changes to the file `conf.py`. You should at least check if those two variables contain the right things:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "extensions = [\n",
    "    'nbsphinx',\n",
    "    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n",
    "]\n",
    "exclude_patterns = ['_build', '**.ipynb_checkpoints']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your `conf.py` is in place, edit the file `index.rst` and add the file names of your notebooks (without the `.ipynb` extension) to the `toctree` directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the HTML pages, use this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sphinx-build <source-dir> <build-dir>\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you have many notebooks, you can do a parallel build by using the `-j` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sphinx-build <source-dir> <build-dir> -j<number-of-processes>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your source files are in the current directory and you have 4 CPU cores, you can run this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sphinx-build . _build -j4\n",
    "    \n",
    "Afterwards, you can find the main HTML file in `_build/index.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create LaTeX output, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sphinx-build <source-dir> <build-dir> -b latex\n",
    "    \n",
    "Subsequent builds will be faster, because only those source files which have changed will be re-built.\n",
    "To force re-building all source files, use the `-E` option."
