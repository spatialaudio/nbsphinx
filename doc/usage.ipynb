    "# Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install `nbsphinx` with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install nbsphinx --user\n",
    "\n",
    "If you suddenly change your mind, you can un-install it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip uninstall nbsphinx\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your Python installation, you may have to use `python` instead of `python3`.\n",
    "Recent versions of Python already come with `pip` pre-installed.\n",
    "If you don't have it, you can [install it manually](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Highlighting\n",
    "\n",
    "To get proper syntax highlighting in code cells, you'll need an appropriate *Pygments lexer*.\n",
    "This of course depends on the programming language of your Jupyter notebooks (more specifically, the `pygments_lexer` metadata of your notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use Python in your notebooks, you'll have to have the `IPython` package installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install IPython --user\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll most likely have this installed already.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute your notebooks during the Sphinx build process (see [Executing Notebooks](executing-notebooks.ipynb)), you need an appropriate [Jupyter kernel](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use Python, you should install the `ipykernel` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install ipykernel --user\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it's very likely that you have that installed already."

    "## Sphinx Setup\n",
    "\n",

    "    python3 -m sphinx.quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the questions that appear on the screen. In case of doubt, just press the `<Return>` key repeatedly to take the default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, there will be a few brand-new files in the current directory.\n",
    "You'll have to make a few changes to the file named [conf.py](conf.py). You should at least check if those two variables contain the right things:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "extensions = [\n",
    "    'nbsphinx',\n",
    "    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n",
    "]\n",
    "exclude_patterns = ['_build', '**.ipynb_checkpoints']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your `conf.py` is in place, edit the file named `index.rst` and add the file names of your notebooks (with or without the `.ipynb` extension) to the [toctree](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/toctree.html) directive.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are using the `sphinx.ext.autosummary` Sphinx extension, there is [a bug in Sphinx (below version 1.5)](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/2485) which prevents notebooks from being parsed. \n",
    "As a work-around you can explicitly list all the files for which autosummary should be ran using the  [autosummary_generate](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autosummary.html#confval-autosummary_generate) variable in `conf.py`.  For example,\n",

    "    python3 -m sphinx <source-dir> <build-dir>\n",
