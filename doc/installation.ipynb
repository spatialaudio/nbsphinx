    "## nbsphinx Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the aforementioned packages will install some of these prerequisites automatically, some of the things may be already installed on your computer anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you'll need Python, because both Sphinx and `nbsphinx` are implemented in Python.\n",
    "There are many ways to get Python.\n",
    "If you don't know which one is best for you, you can try [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sphinx\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) as well, because `nbsphinx` is just a Sphinx extension and doesn't do anything on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use `conda`, you can get [Sphinx from the conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can install it with `pip` (see below):\n",

    "\n",
    "### pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent versions of Python already come with `pip` pre-installed.\n",
    "If you don't have it, you can [install it manually](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### pandoc\n",
    "\n",
    "The stand-alone program [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is used to convert Markdown content to something Sphinx can understand. You have to install this program separately, ideally with your package manager. If you are using `conda`, you can install [pandoc from the conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandoc):\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge pandoc\n",

    "### Pygments Lexer for Syntax Highlighting\n",
    "\n",
    "To get proper syntax highlighting in code cells, you'll need an appropriate *Pygments lexer*.\n",
    "This of course depends on the programming language of your Jupyter notebooks (more specifically, the `pygments_lexer` metadata of your notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use Python in your notebooks, you'll have to have the `IPython` package installed, e.g. with\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge ipython\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install IPython --user\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Anaconda with the default channel and syntax highlighting in code cells doesn't seem to work,\n",
    "you can try to install IPython from the `conda-forge` channel or directly with `pip`, or as a work-around,\n",
    "add `'IPython.sphinxext.ipython_console_highlighting'` to `extensions` in your `conf.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details, see [Anaconda issue #1430](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1430) and\n",

    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute your notebooks during the Sphinx build process (see [Controlling Notebook Execution](executing-notebooks.ipynb)), you need an appropriate [Jupyter kernel](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use Python, you should install the `ipykernel` package, e.g. with\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pip install ipykernel --user\n",
    "\n",
    "If you created your notebooks yourself with Jupyter, it's very likely that you have the right kernel installed already."
