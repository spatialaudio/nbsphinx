    "# Using `toctree` In A Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sphinx-based documentation, there is typically a file called `index.rst` which contains one or more [toctree](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree) directives.\n",
    "Those can be used to pull in further source files (which themselves can contain further `toctree` directives).\n",
    "\n",
    "With `nbsphinx` it is possible to get a similar effect within a Jupyter notebook using the\n",
    "`nbsphinx-toctree` cell tag or cell metadata.\n",
    "Markdown cells with `nbsphinx-toctree` tag/metadata are not converted like \"normal\" Markdown cells.\n",
    "Instead, they are only scanned for links to other notebooks (or `*.rst` files and other Sphinx source files) and those links are added to a `toctree` directive.\n",
    "External links can also be used, but they will not be visible in the LaTeX output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a section title in the selected cell,\n",
    "it is used as `toctree` caption (but it also works without a title).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are satisfied with the default settings,\n",
    "you can simply use `nbsphinx-toctree` as a cell tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can store `nbsphinx-toctree` cell metadata.\n",
